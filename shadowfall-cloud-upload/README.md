# Shadowfall Cloud Upload Package

This folder is a ready-to-upload copy of the Shadowfall pixel RPG experience. Drop the entire `shadowfall-cloud-upload` directory into a GitHub repository (or compress it) and you will have a self-contained build with all assets, styles, and scripts.

## Structure

- `index.html` launches the animated start screen.
- `css/` holds the Press Start themed launcher styles.
- `js/` provides launcher interactivity.
- `game/` contains the in-world adventure (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript modules).
- `TESTING.md` reminds you how to re-run the syntax checks for the launcher and main game scripts.

## Getting started

1. Upload the folder to GitHub (or extract it in your project workspace).
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to explore the launcher.
3. Dive into `game/index.html` to run the core adventure scene.

Enjoy exploring and customizing the Shadowfall cloud build!
